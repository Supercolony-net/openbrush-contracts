# Getting Started
Welcome to OpenBrush documentation !
This documentation aim to guide you through the usage of OpenBrush library.

## What is OpenBrush
OpenBrush is a library for smart contract development on ink!
It provides standard contracts ([based on PSP](https://github.com/w3f/PSPs)), as well as useful contracts and macros to help you build ink! smart contracts.

## Why OpenBrush
OpenBrush attempt to analogize OpenZeppelin perfectly with Rust’s paradigm, enabling users to import contracts implemented by another user without problems and reuse the code.
There was a need to have a library that can provide base implementations of ERCs and to import/reuse them by customizing their own logic.
