## Deployment of ink! based smart contracts

This document contains description of how to deploy and test smart contracts locally and in testnet.

### Ecosystem

Polkadot doesn't support smart contract execution, only parachains can provide this functionality. More information
about how it works you can find on [official wiki](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/build-smart-contracts).

The list of standalone blockchain/parachains that support ink! smart contracts:

* [Edgeware](https://edgewa.re)
* [PlasmNetwork](https://www.plasmnet.io)
