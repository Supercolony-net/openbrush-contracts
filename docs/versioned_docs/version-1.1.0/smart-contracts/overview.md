This doc contains examples of how the library can be used and how to customize the base implementation.

* [PSP22](PSP22/psp22.md) shows an example of how you can reuse the implementation of
  [psp22](https://github.com/Supercolony-net/openbrush-contracts/tree/main/contracts/token/psp22) token (in the same way you can reuse
  [psp721](https://github.com/Supercolony-net/openbrush-contracts/tree/main/contracts/token/psp721) and [psp1155](https://github.com/Supercolony-net/openbrush-contracts/tree/main/contracts/token/psp1155)).
  * [PSP22Metadata](PSP22/Extensions/metadata.md): metadata for PSP22.
  * [PSP22Mintable](PSP22/Extensions/mintable.md): creation of new tokens.
  * [PSP22Burnable](PSP22/Extensions/burnable.md): destruction of own tokens.
  * [PSP22Wrapper](PSP22/Extensions/wrapper.md): wrapper for PSP22 token (useful for governance tokens etc.).
  * [PSP22FlashMint](PSP22/Extensions/flashmint.md): extension which allows performing flashloans of the token by minting and burning the token.
  * [PSP22Pausable](PSP22/Extensions/pausable.md): example of using pausable extension in the PSP22 contract.
  * [PSP22Capped](PSP22/Extensions/capped.md): extension which adds a cap for total supply of PSP22 tokens.
  * [PSP22TokenTimelock](PSP22/Utils/token-timelock.md): Utility which allows token holders to lock their tokens for a specified amount of time.
* [Access Control](access-control.md) shows how you can use the implementation of
  [access-control](https://github.com/Supercolony-net/openbrush-contracts/tree/main/contracts/access/access-control) and
  [psp721](https://github.com/Supercolony-net/openbrush-contracts/tree/main/contracts/token/psp721) together to provide rights to mint and burn NFT tokens.
* [Ownable](ownable.md) shows how you can use the implementation of
  [ownable](https://github.com/Supercolony-net/openbrush-contracts/tree/main/contracts/access/ownable) and
  [psp1155](https://github.com/Supercolony-net/openbrush-contracts/tree/main/contracts/token/psp1155) together to provide rights to mint and burn tokens.
* [ReentrancyGuard](reentrancy-guard.md) shows how you can use the implementation of
  [non_reentrant](https://github.com/Supercolony-net/openbrush-contracts/tree/main/contracts/security/reentrancy-guard)
  modifier to prevent reentrancy during certain functions.
* [Pausable](pausable.md) shows how you can use the implementation of
  [pausable](https://github.com/Supercolony-net/openbrush-contracts/tree/main/contracts/security/pausable)
  contract and modifiers.
* [TimelockController](timelock-controller.md) shows how you can use the implementation of
  [timelock-controller](https://github.com/Supercolony-net/openbrush-contracts/tree/main/contracts/governance/timelock-controller)
  to execute a transaction with some delay via governance.
* [PaymentSplitter](payment-splitter.md) shows how you can use the implementation of
  [payment-splitter](https://github.com/Supercolony-net/openbrush-contracts/tree/main/contracts/finance/payment-splitter)
  to split received native tokens between participants of the contract.
