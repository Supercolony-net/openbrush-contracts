Welcome to OpenBrush documentation! This documentation aims to guide you through the usage of OpenBrush library.

## What is OpenBrush
OpenBrush is a library for smart contract development on ink!
It provides standard contracts ([based on PSP](https://github.com/w3f/PSPs)), 
as well as useful contracts and macros to help you build ink! smart contracts.

## Why OpenBrush
OpenBrush attempts to analogize OpenZeppelin perfectly with Rustâ€™s paradigm, 
enabling users to import contracts implemented by another user without problems 
and reuse the code.
There was a need to have a library that can provide base implementations of 
ERCs and to import/reuse them by customizing their own logic.
